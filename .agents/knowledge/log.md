# Knowledge log

Append one entry per change to the bundle. Newest first. Keep entries short: what changed and why,
not how.

This file and `index.md` are reserved OKF filenames - they carry no `type:` frontmatter and are not
counted as concepts.

## 2026-10-17 - develop branch, as in IGNIS

Updated [releasing](/process/releasing.md) and [design decisions](/overview/design-decisions.md): pull
requests target `develop`, `main` only receives merges from `develop`, and releases run from `develop`.

## 2026-10-17 - IGNIS rules adopted

Updated [design decisions](/overview/design-decisions.md): VULCAN's `.agents/rules.md` now holds IGNIS's W, S, P, B rules
with IGNIS's IDs, adapted to VULCAN. VULCAN's old B-05 (Bun only) is B-01; B-05 is now "`vulcan x atlas`
runs `dist`".

## 2026-10-17 - bundle split into IGNIS's folders

Rebuilt the bundle as [overview](/overview/what-is-vulcan.md), [packages](/packages/cli.md),
[architecture](/architecture/project-contract.md), [conventions](/conventions/coding-style.md) and
[process](/process/releasing.md), matching IGNIS. Facts corrected on the way: release tooling exists,
atlas generators take about 1 s, `init` writes no `.mcp.json`, root `scripts/` exists, base IDs
carry `V-`.

## 2026-10-17 - the repository became its own first project

Three packages (cli, okf, atlas), the shipped base, OKF v0.2 for this bundle.

## 2026-10-16 - tooling moved from IGNIS

Tooling moved from IGNIS `develop` `8dc189d9`; the repository took the IGNIS layout.
